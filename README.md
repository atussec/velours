# Plasma 5 theme
![Velours in Plasma 4](http://i.imgur.com/Johbmnd.png "Velours in Plasma 4")
A dark plasma theme with a fuzzy texture and monochromatic icons.
It draws inspiration from Caledonia by Malcer (which it was originally a fork of) and openSUSE by sumski.

Since v3.0, it contains only original artwork.

It might not fit everyone's use case. Don't hesitate to ask for specific missing parts if need be.

To install this theme, either clone the plasma5 branch or download the archive in the Packaged branch and extract it in ~/.local/share/plasma/desktoptheme/ .

This branch was created specially for Plasma 5 since it handles tray icons differently.
