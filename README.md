# Plasma 4 theme
![Velours in Plasma 4](http://i.imgur.com/Johbmnd.png "Velours in Plasma 4")
A dark plasma theme with a fuzzy texture and monochromatic icons, designed to be easy on the eyes, simple and effective. It draws inspiration from Caledonia by Malcer (which it was originally a fork of) and openSUSE by sumski.

To install this theme, either clone this repository or extract a release in ~/.local/share/plasma/desktoptheme/ for a local user or globally in /usr/share/plasma/desktoptheme/ .
