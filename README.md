# velours
A dark plasma theme with a fuzzy texture and monochromatic icons.
It draws inspiration from Caledonia by Malcer (which it was originally a fork of) and openSUSE by sumski.

Since v3, it contains only original artwork.

It might not fit everyone's use case. Don't hesitate to ask for specific missing parts if need be.
Not tested thoroughly under Plasma 5 yet but it seems to be working well enough for now.
