# Plasma 4 theme
![Velours in Plasma 4](https://github.com/obnosim/velours/blob/packaged/velours3.png?raw=true "Velours in Plasma 4")
A dark plasma theme with a fuzzy texture and monochromatic icons.
It draws inspiration from Caledonia by Malcer (which it was originally a fork of) and openSUSE by sumski.

Since v3.0, it contains only original artwork.

It might not fit everyone's use case. Don't hesitate to ask for specific missing parts if need be.

To install this theme, either clone the master branch or download the archive in the Packaged branch and extract it in ~/.kde[4]/share/apps/desktoptheme/ .

This branch was designed with Plasma 4 in mind. It works with Plasma 5 too, but there are slight differences that make it suboptimal. For example, tray icons in Plasma 5 are stuck to 22x22, while they would stretch to fit their panel in Plasma 4. Since icons in this branch are 24x24, they appear blurry and ugly in Plasma5. For this reason, a Plasma5 branch was created specially to offer better icons.
